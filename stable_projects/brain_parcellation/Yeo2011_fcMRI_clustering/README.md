## Parcellation Release
The pacellations are released in `1000subjects_reference` folder. Specifically, the pacellations include:
- **1000subjects_clusters007_ref.mat, 1000subjects_clusters017_ref.mat**
7/17-network brain pacellation

- **Yeo_JNeurophysiol11_SplitLabels**
A connected component analysis was performed on the original 7/17-network brain parcellations. For more information, please check `Yeo_JNeurophysiol11_SplitLabels_README` under `Yeo_JNeurophysiol11_SplitLabels` folder

## Code Release
The code utilized in this study are released in `Yeo2011_fcMRI_clustering` folder. Specifically, the code include:
- **CBIG_Yeo2011_general_cluster_fcMRI_surf2surf_profiles.csh**
This function is the main function that calls other scripts in sequence. It assumes that the preprocessed surface data are located in `sub_dir/subject/surf/`. Try `./CBIG_Yeo2011_general_cluster_fcMRI_surf2surf_profiles.csh -help` for more information.

- **Examples**
There is a simple example in `examples` folder. Check how to run the example code and compare the results by reading `examples/README.md`.

Note that this project uses generic functions from other folders, which may be updated over time. To download the version of the code that was last tested, you can either

- visit this link:

or

- run the following command, if you have Git installed
 
```
git checkout -b v0.4.5-Yeo2011_fcMRI_clustering v0.4.5-Yeo2011_fcMRI_clustering
```
